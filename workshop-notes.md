Lage prosjektskall på github? (Henning)

# Agenda


## Intro (3 min. Tomas)
Earlier Kundefront used to have weekly meetings where we foucused on improving our programming skills.
It was successful, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. After request by Henning, I'd like us to start with it again.
What we did last time was reading a couple of books and discussing each chapter togheter. This time, we'll
try with a little twist, and instead do some practical programming excercises.

Since it's our first time solving a Code Kata together, I've scheduled three hours. Next time, I hope we'll be able
to use less time.

## Code Kata (5 min.)
Has any of you heard of Kata? Done it?

A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each.

Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer. The intent behind code kata
is similar to Kata in Karate.

It is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer sharpen their skills through practice and even repetition.
It is normal to solve the same problem several times, but changing how you solve it. Examples of what to change:
* Language
* Pair programming
* TDD
* No mouse
* All methods less that 4 lines
* No mutable state
* No frameworks
